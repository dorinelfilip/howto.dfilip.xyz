This tutorial explains how to configure OpenWRT to authentificate the WAN connection using 802.11x EAP-TLS.

<!--end_excerpt-->

## Step 1: Make sure your OpenWRT image include all the needed packages

Make sure that your OpenWRT at least includes the following packages:

```
libopenssl hostapd-common wpad-openssl -wpad-basic-wolfssl
```
Note: `wpad-basic-wolfssl` is explicitly excluded.

## Step 2: Create configuration files

We need to create:
- /etc/config/wpadot1x.conf

```
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=root
ap_scan=0
network={
	key_mgmt=IEEE8021X
	eap=PEAP
	identity="username"
	password=""
	anonymous_identity="username"
	pairwise=CCMP
	phase2="auth=MSCHAPV2"
	ca_cert="/etc/config/80211x-CA.pem"
	priority=2
}
```

- /etc/init.d/wpadot1x

```
#!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common
# Example script
# Copyright (C) 2007 OpenWrt.org
START=99

start() {
	wpa_supplicant -D wired -B -i eth1 -c /etc/config/wpadot1x.conf
	# wait few secounds
	sleep 5
	#reload wan if - udhcpc lease refresh
        ifup wan && echo "cd802.1x client has started."
}

stop()
{
    kill `ps w | grep "wpa_supplicant -D wired" | awk {'print $1'}` 2>/dev/null
    echo "cd802.1x client has stoped."
}
```

Note: `eth1` should be replaced with the actual WAN interface.

Note: The CA certificate is optional, but recomanded for security.

Note: If you are looking for UPB's CA certificate you can download it from [here](/assets/UPB-CA.crt).

## Step 3: Enable start-up script

Make sure that the init.d script is executable:

```
chmod +x /etc/init.d/wpadot1x
```

Enable the service:

```
/etc/init.d/wpadot1x enable
```
